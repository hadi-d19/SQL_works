-- You are helping design a student registration system for a training institute. You need to:
-- Create a table called students with the following information:
-- student_id (a unique number for each student)
-- name (student's name)
-- email (each student must have a unique email address)
-- Create another table called courses with:
-- course_id (a unique number for each course)
-- course_name (name of the course)
-- Create a table called enrollments to store which student has enrolled in which course. This table should:
-- Include student_id and course_id
-- Make sure both values must match existing records in the other two tables


CREATE TABLE students (student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR (255),email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE);

CREATE TABLE courses (course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,course_name VARCHAR(255));

CREATE TABLE enrollments (student_id INT,course_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id));
