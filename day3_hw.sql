-- You are working for a local bookstore that sells books both online and offline.
--  The manager has asked you to help prepare reports from the books table. The table has the following columns:
-- id (number)
-- title (text)
-- author (text)
-- price (number)
-- stock_status (text: either 'In Stock' or 'Out of Stock')
-- genre (text)
-- Your tasks are:
-- Show all the different genres available in the store (no duplicates).
-- List all books that are in stock and priced below 400.
-- List all books that are either out of stock or have a price above 700.
-- Show the title and price of every book along with a new column that adds 10% GST to the price.

-- Display the title, price, and stock_status of all books, sorted by price from highest to lowest.

SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM books;

SELECT * FROM books WHERE stock_status='In Stock' AND price < 400;

SELECT * FROM books WHERE stock_status='Out of Stock' OR price > 700;

SELECT title, price * 1.10 AS price_with_GST FROM books;

SELECT title,price,stock_status FROM books ORDER BY price DESC;
